// When a share of common stock of some company is sold, the capital gain
// (or, sometimes, loss) is the difference between the share's selling price
// and the price originally paid to buy it. This rule is easy to understand
// for a single share, but if we sell multiple shares of stock bought over
// a long period of time, then we must identify the shares actually being
// sold. A standard accounting principle for identifying which shares of a
// stock were sold in such a case is to use a FIFO protocolâ€”the shares sold
// are the ones that have been held the longest (indeed, this is the default
// method built into several personal finance software packages).
// For example, suppose we:
// buy 100 shares at $20 each on day 1,
// 20 shares at $24 on day 2,
// 200 shares at $36 on day 3,
// and then sell 150 shares on day 4 at $30 each.
// Then applying the FIFO protocol means that of the 150 shares sold, 100
// were bought on day 1, 20 were bought on day 2, and 30 were bought on day
// 3. The capital gain in this case would therefore be
// 100 * 10 + 20 * 6 + 30 *(-6), or $940. Write a program that takes as
// input a sequence of transactions of the form buy x share(s) at $y each
// or sell x share(s) at $y each, assuming that the transactions occur on
// consecutive days and the values and are integers. Given this input sequence,
// the output should be the total capital gain (or loss) for the entire
// sequence, using the FIFO protocol to identify shares.
